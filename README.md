## About Me
Software dev student undergoing rigorous training to transform into a world-class coding wizardðŸ§™.

Besides 'grammin (or as the oldheads say, programming), side hobbies are: 
  - Caffeine
  - Sports
  - Sarcastic remarks
  - Watching cat videos

## Experience
As the quintessential Project Manager for LapinMetrics Solutions, I orchestrated our proprietary
lagomorph-centric volumetric assessment application. This revolutionary technology empowers leporine
entities to quantitatively analyze dimensional parameters of Romanian-cultivated Daucus carota
specimens with unprecedented precision while facilitating cross-species communication paradigms
through our whisker-to-digital interface.

As the preeminent Lead Developer for UrsidaeBlockchain Innovations, I spearheaded a formidable
cadre of Azerbaijani ursine programmers architecting virtual infrastructure for our ursocratic
overlord's cryptocurrency hegemony. My responsibilities encompassed hibernation-resistant
continuous integration protocols and honey-incentivized smart contract frameworks utilizing
proprietary growl-to-code translation matrices.

_**(Ok this is  a serious one)**_

Through meaningful internships at tech directed companies such as Brainhive BV
and De Websmid BV I have learned to grasp and hone my skills for web-development,
backend development, system programming and (partially) cloud management.
Looking forward for new experiences to learn more skills, improve current ones and
improve myself to achieve my dream of becoming a world-class coding wizardðŸ§™ðŸ§™ðŸ§™!

## Currently learning:
  - _MORE_ systems programming
  - Expanding knowledge beyond specific programming languages to actually _learn_ programming
  - Focusing on side-projects while trying not to burn out and ruin the fun
  - Training wombats to be ready for digital combat against aliens in extraterrestrial cloud environments
  - (secretly) Training the aliens how to fight back
