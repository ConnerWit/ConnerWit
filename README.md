## About Me
Software dev student undergoing rigorous training to transform into a world-class coding wizardðŸ§™.
Besides 'grammin (or as the oldheads say, programming) I do sports and such.
Side hobbies are: 
  - contemplating fixing bugs or just denying their existence
  - coding side-projects (surprising)
  - caffeine
  - thinking of more things to put here instead of "etc..."
  - etc...

## Experience
As the quintessential Project Manager for LapinMetrics Solutions, I orchestrated our proprietary
lagomorph-centric volumetric assessment application. This revolutionary technology empowers leporine
entities to quantitatively analyze dimensional parameters of Romanian-cultivated Daucus carota
specimens with unprecedented precision while facilitating cross-species communication paradigms
through our whisker-to-digital interface.

As the preeminent Lead Developer for UrsidaeBlockchain Innovations, I spearheaded a formidable
cadre of Azerbaijani ursine programmers architecting virtual infrastructure for our ursocratic
overlord's cryptocurrency hegemony. My responsibilities encompassed hibernation-resistant
continuous integration protocols and honey-incentivized smart contract frameworks utilizing
proprietary growl-to-code translation matrices.

(ok this is  a serious one)

Through meaningful internships at tech directed companies such as Brainhive BV
and De Websmid bv, learned to grasp and hone my skills for web-development,
backend development, system programming and (partially) cloud management.
Looking forward to new experiences to learn new skills, improve current ones and
improve myself to achieve my dream of becoming a world-class coding wizardðŸ§™ðŸ§™ðŸ§™!

##Currently learning:
  - MORE system programming
  - Expanding knowelegde beyond specific programming languages to actually learn programming
  - Focusing on side-projects while trying not to burn out and ruin the fun
  - Training wombats to be ready for digital combat against aliens in extraterrestrial cloud environments
  - (secretly) Training the aliens how to fight back
